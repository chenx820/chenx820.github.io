However, building a robust quantum computer with semiconductor spin qubits faces significant challenges, the most pressing being noise—particularly charge noise. To address this critical ssue, it is essential to first study and understand the underlying mechanisms of charge noise.","iframe":"//chenx820.github.io/research/chargenoies_viva_20250618.pdf","title":"Charge noise in semiconductor qubits"},"fields":{"slug":"/research/charge-noise-in-semiconductor-qubits"}}},{"node":{"id":"e9b354ca-ca85-5cdd-908c-c9e35e19b3f5","frontmatter":{"excerpt":"Quantum operations with multiple trapped-ions rely on the collective vibrational modes of the ion chain, known as phonons. Critical parameters such as ion positions, phonon frequencies, and the strength of ion-phonon interactions are closely related to the structure of the ion trap chip, the surrounding environment, and the configuration of the trapping potential. To achieve high-performance trapped-ion quantum computing, precise calibration of system parameters is essential.","iframe":"//chenx820.github.io/research/baidu_calibration_20230831.pdf","title":"Automatic calibration for trapped-ion systems"},"fields":{"slug":"/research/automatic-calibration-for-trapped-ion-systems"}}}]}}}
