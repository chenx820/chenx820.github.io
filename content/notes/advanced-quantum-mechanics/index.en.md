Advanced Quantum Mechanics with Professor Yong Hu was a fantastic and challenging course. I took it as an undergraduate, and it offers deep insights for anyone with a good grasp of introductory quantum mechanics. These are my study notes from the class. **(Note: written in Chinese)**.

One of the most interesting parts was a homework assignment on the "Quantum Swing," which I had a lot of fun simulating with a QuTiP script. You can find a write-up and the code for that project on my Zhihu page.

The course primarily referenced J. J. Sakurai's classic textbook, _Modern Quantum Mechanics_.
