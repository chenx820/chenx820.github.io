This is a collection of various notes and summaries for high school physics. The materials come from different sourcesâ€”some are summaries from question sheets, while others are notes from the excellent courses taught by **Nan Li**.

While the sequence might be a bit mixed, I believe these resources are all helpful for understanding different parts of the curriculum.
