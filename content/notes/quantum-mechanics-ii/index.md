- [**Chapter 2:** Path Integral Formalism of Quantum Mechanics](quantum-mechanics-ii/pdf/ch2-path-integral-formalism-of-qm.pdf)
- [**Chapter 3:** The WKB Approximation](quantum-mechanics-ii/pdf/ch3-the-wkb-approximation.pdf)
- [**Chapter 4:** Rotation and Vibration of Molecules](quantum-mechanics-ii/pdf/ch4-rotation-and-vibration-of-molecules.pdf)
- [**Chapter 5:** Variational Principle and Two-Particle Systems](quantum-mechanics-ii/pdf/ch5-variational-principle-with-its-application-to-two-particle-systems.pdf)
- [**Chapter 6:** Introduction to Many-Body Theory](quantum-mechanics-ii/pdf/ch6-introduction-to-many-body-theory.pdf)
