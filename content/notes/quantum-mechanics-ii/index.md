These are my lecture notes from the **Quantum Mechanics II** course, part of the 2020 Summer School at Peking University, taught by Professor Zhixin Qian.

The notes are organized by chapter, following the structure of the course:

- [**Chapter 1:** Phase in quantum mechanics](/notes/quantum-mechanics-ii/pdf/ch1-phase-in-qm.pdf)
- [**Chapter 2:** Path integral formalism of quantum mechanics](/notes/quantum-mechanics-ii/pdf/ch2-path-integral-formalism-of-qm.pdf)
- [**Chapter 3:** The WKB approximation](/notes/quantum-mechanics-ii/pdf/ch3-the-wkb-approximation.pdf)
- **Chapter 4:** The density matrix (not available)
- [**Chapter 5:** Rotation and vibration of molecules](/notes/quantum-mechanics-ii/pdf/ch5-rotation-and-vibration-of-molecules.pdf)
- [**Chapter 6:** Variational principle and two-particle systems](/notes/quantum-mechanics-ii/pdf/ch6-variational-principle-with-its-application-to-two-particle-systems.pdf)
- [**Chapter 7:** Introduction to many-body theory](/notes/quantum-mechanics-ii/pdf/ch7-introduction-to-many-body-theory.pdf)
