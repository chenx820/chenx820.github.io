These are my notes for Mathematical Methods in Physics, a course that was divided into two parts, each taught by a different professor.

- [**Complex Analysis (PDF)**](/notes/mathematical-methods-in-physics/pdf/review-complex-analysis.pdf): Taught by Professor Cheng-Gang Shao.
- [**Equations of Mathematical Physics (PDF)**](/notes/mathematical-methods-in-physics/pdf/equations-of-mathematical-physics.pdf): Taught by Professor Yong Hu.
