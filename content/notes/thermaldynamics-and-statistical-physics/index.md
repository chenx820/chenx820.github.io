This course, taught by Prof. Shun Wang, was quite challenging. It was conducted entirely in English, including the coursework and exams. Each week, we were
required to read research papers, answer related questions, and at the end of the term, we wrote a small essay. Additionally, I worked on a small project focused
on the Ising Model. My study notes are primarily based on the textbook by David Tong.
