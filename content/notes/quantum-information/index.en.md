Here are my notes for **Quantum Information**, a fascinating course taught by my supervisor, [Professor Myungshik Kim](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.kim).

My notes synthesize the key concepts from his lectures and the foundational textbook by Nielsen and Chuang. They cover:

- Elements of quantum mechanics and quantum information
- Quantum algorithms
- Physical realisation - trapped ions
- Decoherence and quantum error correction
- Properties and applications of entangled states
