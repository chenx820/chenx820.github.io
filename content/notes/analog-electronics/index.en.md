These are my notes for **Analog Electronics**, taught by Professor Tian-Ping Deng. We took this course online during the spring 2020 term, and my notes are based on the [HUST MOOC](https://www.icourse163.org/course/hust-481015).

To be honest, I initially found this course to be my least favorite as an undergraduate. As a physics student, I prefer learning about fundamental principles, and this felt more like engineering. However, it turned out to be one of the most useful courses I've ever taken, proving essential to my postgraduate experimental research. I'm thankful I have these notes for a quick and easy review.
