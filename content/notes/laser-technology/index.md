This course covers two main topics: Laser Device Technology and Nonlinear Optics. I am not particularly interested in the first topic, as it focuses primarily on conceptual understanding and requires memorizing numerous concepts for exams, rather than employing rigorous mathematical derivations to prove or explore the principles in depth.
