Here are my notes for high school biology, created specifically for efficient and targeted **Gaokao** preparation.

This guide consolidates the most critical concepts, diagrams, and problem-solving strategies into a single document, designed to help you review the core material effectively before the exam.

[**Download the Golden Nuggets (PDF)**](/notes/high-school-biology/pdf/biology-golden-nuggets.pdf) with essential facts and summaries for quick review.

This collection features a series of mind maps I created for my high school biology course, designed to make complex topics easier to visualize and remember.

Below is a preview of the mind maps, which cover key areas of cell biology, genetics, evolution, and ecology. I've also compiled a ["Golden Nuggets"](high-school-biology/pdf/biology-golden-nuggets.pdf) with essential facts and summaries for quick review.
