This mind map was created as a study guide for the final exam in **Modern Chinese History**.

Since history isn't my strongest subject, I focused on creating a clear and concise visual overview. The content is organized strictly around the key points and topics emphasized in the lectures, making it a targeted tool for exam preparation.
