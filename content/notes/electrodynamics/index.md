These notes were created to prepare for the final exam in **Electrodynamics**, taught by Professor Zhao-Feng Kang.

More than just a summary of key points, this guide also provides a breakdown of the important **physics models** essential for solving problems in electrodynamics. It's designed to be a comprehensive tool for both review and practical application.
