This was a particularly challenging course taught by Professor Shun Wang, conducted entirely in **English**, including all coursework and exams. The curriculum was rigorous, requiring us to read and analyze research papers each week and write a term essay.

My notes are primarily based on the excellent textbook by **David Tong**. This guide is for students looking for a deep dive into the subject.

As part of the course, I also completed a project [modeling the 2D Ising model using the Metropolis algorithm](https://chenx820.github.io/blog/ferromagnetism-in-the-ising-model-using-the-metropolis-algorithm).
