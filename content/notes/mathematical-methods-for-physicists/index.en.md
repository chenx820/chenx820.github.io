This was one of my favorite courses at Imperial, taught by the excellent [Professor Fay Dowker](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/f.dowker). Her clear teaching was a huge factor in helping me achieve a final grade of 96/100.

Here are the notes I created for the course, including a comprehensive summary and a targeted revision guide for the final exam.
