These are my notes for the graduate-level **Quantum Optics** course. The material is based on their lecture notes and covers key topics like:

- Semi-classical atom-field interaction (optical Bloch equations, Ramsey interferometry)
- Field quantisation (Fock states, coherent states)
- Fluctuations and correlations (Mach-Zahnder interferometry, Hanbury-Brown-Twiss experiment, Hong-Ou-Mandel effect)
- Quasi-probabilities (Wigner function, Husimi function)
- Current quantum optical experiments
- Atom-field interaction (dipole interaction, Jaynes-Cumming model)

A special thanks to **Hao Chen**, a PhD candidate at Princeton University, for his insightful discussions which greatly enriched my understanding.

We are currently co-authoring an extended version of these notes, which will include additional topics for a more comprehensive learning experience.
