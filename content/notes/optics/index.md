This term was unique due to COVID-19, as we had to attend lectures online from home. The course was taught by Prof. Lu-Shuai Cao and Prof. Ze-Huang Lu. My notes
were selected as exemplary for the course and shared with classmates. Due to the large file size, the notes have been divided into four parts.

- [Optics part 1](optics/pdf/optics-part1.pdf)
- [Optics part 2](optics/pdf/optics-part2.pdf)
- [Optics part 3](optics/pdf/optics-part3.pdf)
- [Optics part 4](optics/pdf/optics-part4.pdf)
