These are my notes for the undergraduate Optics course, taught by Professor Lu-Shuai Cao and Professor Ze-Huang Lu. I was honored that they were selected as **exemplary notes** for the course and shared with all my classmates.

We took this course online during the unique Spring 2020 term. Due to their large file size, I have divided them into four parts.

- [**Optics - Part 1 (PDF)**](optics/pdf/optics-part1.pdf)
- [**Optics - Part 2 (PDF)**](optics/pdf/optics-part2.pdf)
- [**Optics - Part 3 (PDF)**](optics/pdf/optics-part3.pdf)
- [**Optics - Part 4 (PDF)**](optics/pdf/optics-part4.pdf)
