This course was taught by Prof. Ying Wu and Prof. Jia-Hua Li. However, it overlapped with another advanced course I had selected, so I decided to learn independently. My studies were based on Griffiths' Introduction to Quantum Mechanics and the online course from [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-04-quantum-physics-i-spring-2016/](MIT OCW).
