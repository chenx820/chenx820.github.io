Here are my notes for high school chemistry, structured in two parts to support both in-depth learning and efficient Gaokao preparation. Special thanks to my classmate **Kunpeng Li**, who generously provided his own class notes for me to reference.

- [**Comprehensive Course Notes (PDF)**](/notes/high-school-chemistry/pdf/chemistry.pdf): Detailed notes covering the entire curriculum.
- [**Final Review Guide (PDF)**](/notes/high-school-chemistry/pdf/chemistry-review.pdf): A condensed summary of key concepts for quick revision.
- [**Material Structure Reasoning**](/notes/high-school-chemistry/pdf/reasoning.pdf): A guide to tackling reasoning questions about material structure.
