title: Quantum Compilation with Neutral Atoms
excerpt: In recent years, quantum computing has made significant progress in both hardware and software. However, executing quantum algorithms efficiently on physical systems still requires a crucial compilation step to translate logical quantum circuits into hardware-executable instructions — a field that remains in its early stages.
