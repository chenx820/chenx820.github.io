This course was taught by Prof. Florian Mintert and Prof. Michael Vanner. My notes were based on their lecture materials, covering topics such as atom-field interactions, coherent state and squeezed state, quantum detection, etc. Special thanks to Hao Chen, a PhD candidate at Princeton University, for insightful discussions. We are currently coauthoring an extended
note on quantum optics, enriched with additional essential topics to provide a more comprehensive understanding and enhance the overall learning experience.
