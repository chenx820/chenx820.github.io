title: Charge noise in semiconductor qubits
excerpt: Semiconductor qubits are a promising candidate for quantum computing, owing to their compatibility with existing semiconductor fabrication techniques, long coherence times, and scalability for large-scale integration. However, building a robust quantum computer with semiconductor spin qubits faces significant challenges, the most pressing being noise—particularly charge noise. To address this critical ssue, it is essential to first study and understand the underlying mechanisms of charge noise.

  abstract: Semiconductor qubits are a promising candidate for quantum computing, owing to their compatibility with existing semiconductor fabrication techniques, long coherence times, and scalability for large-scale integration. However, building a robust quantum computer with semiconductor spin qubits faces significant challenges, the most pressing being noise—particularly charge noise. Charge noise accelerates decoherence, leading to quantum state dephasing caused by external disturbances, which undermines the stability and reliability of qubit operations. To address this critical ssue, it is essential to first study and understand the underlying mechanisms of charge noise.
