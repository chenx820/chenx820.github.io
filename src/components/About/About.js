            <br />
            I am passionate about advancing quantum computing through both
            theoretical research and experimental realization. My academic
            journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in physics and
            hands-on experience with a variety of quantum systems, including
            neutral atoms, trapped ions, and semiconductor qubits.
            <br />
            <br />I also work with quantum circuits. At BAQIS, my research
            focuses on developing efficient quantum compilation strategies that
            help bridge the gap between hardware capabilities and practical,
            scalable quantum computing.
